| Cora | Given a citation graph: { "id": "cora_356", "graph": { "node_idx": 356, "node_list": [356, 190, 510, 519, 2223, 192], "one_hop_neighbors": [190, 510], "two_hops_neighbors": [192, 519, 2223], "node_label": ["Neural_Networks", "Neural_Networks", "Probabilistic_Methods", "Neural_Networks", "Neural_Networks", "Neural_Networks"] }, where the 0th node is the target paper, with the following information: Title: <Title Text>, Abstract: <Abstract Text>. <br />And in the 'node label' list / 'GNN-predicted node label' list, you'll find the human-annotated / GNN-predicted subcategories corresponding to the neighbors within two hops of the target paper as per the 'node_list'. <br />Question: Which CS sub-category does this paper belong to? Give the most likely CS sub-categories of this paper directly, choosing from "Case_Based", "Genetic_Algorithms", "Neural_Networks", "Probabilistic_Methods", "Reinforcement_Learning", "Rule_Learning", "Theory".<br />Ensure that your response can be parsed by Python json, using the following format as an example: {"classification result": "Genetic_Algorithms", "explanation": "your explanation for your classification here"}. Ensure that the classification result must match one of the given choices. |
